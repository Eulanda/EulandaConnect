> **Local links in this readme document do not work, they are rendered for online documentation in HUGO CMS.**

> **Version 3.1** is now live and available as an open-source project! We are thrilled to present this powerful new release, with over **18,000** lines of PowerShell source code and more than **180** documented functions (in total more then **260**), now available in the PowerShell Gallery. It is important to note that EulandaConnect is not solely reliant on the EULANDA-ERP system; indeed, about half of the functions can be used independently. Particularly, the file transfer functions, MSSQL functions, and network functions are universally applicable across scenarios.
>
> More than 80 **Pester** tests for over 30 functions have now been added. Thus, about 10% of the EulandaConnect functions are tested via a Pester test function.
>
> In this release, we introduce a revamped **MSSQL backup** system, capable of securing your data across NAS, SFTP, FTP, and FTPS. Additionally, we've enriched the module with more than 10 new functions to interact with FTP, **SFTP**, and FTPS, including the remarkable ability to resume interrupted uploads. We are excited to introduce new functions designed specifically for creating **snapshots** or **symbolic links**. Also new is the ability to convert **datanorm** 4 files into a PowerShell object and into the eulanda-specific xml format.
