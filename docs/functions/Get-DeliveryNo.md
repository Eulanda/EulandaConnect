# Get-DeliveryNo

## SYNOPSIS
Returns the delivery bill number based on its `Id`

## SYNTAX

```
Get-DeliveryNo [[-deliveryId] <Int32>] [[-conn] <Object>] [[-udl] <String>] [[-connStr] <String>]
 [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Based on a delivery bill `Id` the delivery bill number is returned. The database can be specified via a Connection object, a UDL file or a ConnectionString.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1:Returns the delivery note number
```powershell
PS C:\> [int]$deliveryNo= Get-DeliveryNo -deliveryId 25 -udl "C:\temp\Eulanda_1 JohnDoe.udl"
```

After execution of the command, the variable `$deliveryNo` contains the delivery bill number of the delivery bill to which the `Id` `25` belongs. The database is accessed by specifying a UDL file. Instead, an existing Connection object could also be specified.

## PARAMETERS

### -conn
The connection can be established via an existing ADO object of the type 'ADODB.Connection'. If the connection is already open, it remains open even after the function has been executed. If it was closed, it will be closed again after the function has been executed.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -connStr
A `ConnectionString` can be specified here, with which a database can be opened.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 3
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -deliveryId
The delivery note is searched for by its ID.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -udl
Alternatively to a connection, a string to a UDL file can be specified. In this case an ADO object is created and closed again at the end of the function.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
