# Get-ArticleNo

## SYNOPSIS
This PowerShell function returns the article number based on an ID or barcode. This function requires an EULANDA ERP system. Source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Eulanda/EulandaConnect/blob/master/source/public/Get-ArticleNo.ps1).

## SYNTAX

```
Get-ArticleNo [[-barcode] <String>] [[-articleNo] <String>] [[-articleId] <Int32>] [[-articleUid] <Guid>]
 [[-conn] <Object>] [[-udl] <String>] [[-connStr] <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This can be used to determine the article number of an article. The search can be made either via its Id or its barcode (= GTIN). In case of a barcode search, the database should be modified, since the barcode is defined ambiguously by default. If neither a `barcode` nor an `Id` is passed, the function throws an **exception**.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1:Returns the article number based on a GTIN
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-ArticleNo -barcode '4014751021005' -udl "C:\temp\Eulanda_1 JohnDoe.udl"
```

The function returns the Id of the article with the barcode number (= GTIN) '4014751021005'. In this example, the database is opened via a UDL file.

## PARAMETERS

### -articleId
The `ArticleId` is a unique key in the table. It is normally only used internally to link tables together.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -articleNo
The `ArticleNo` is a unique alphanumeric field in the ERP system. If the value is set, then the article is searched by this number.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -articleUid
A UID (Unique Identifier) is a unique identifier assigned to a specific record in a database. In the context of EULANDA ERP software, each article is assigned a UID to uniquely identify it, regardless of its name, number, or other properties. The UID is usually automatically generated by the database and has a fixed length and formatting to ensure its uniqueness. The `articleUid` parameter is used to specify the UID of the article to retrieve the record.

```yaml
Type: Guid
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 3
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -barcode
The barcode (= GTIN) is a field in the article table which is not defined as a unique field by default. However, if you want to achieve a reliable search, the field should be set to uniqueness in the database beforehand.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -conn
The connection can be established via an existing ADO object of the type 'ADODB.Connection'. If the connection is already open, it remains open even after the function has been executed. If it was closed, it will be closed again after the function has been executed.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 4
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -connStr
A `ConnectionString` can be specified here, with which a database can be opened.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 6
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -udl
Alternatively to a connection, a string to a UDL file can be specified. In this case an ADO object is created and closed again at the end of the function.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 5
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
