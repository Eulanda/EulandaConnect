# Convert-FromDatanorm

## SYNOPSIS
Converts a Datanorm 4.0 file into a structured PowerShell object.

## SYNTAX

```
Convert-FromDatanorm [[-path] <String>] [[-mwSt] <Double>] [[-decimalSeparator] <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The function `Convert-FromDatanorm` reads a Datanorm file and converts it into a collection of PowerShell objects arranged in a hierarchical data structure. Currently, it can process the following types of records:

1. Type `V`: Version Data - Carries version information, date, and additional text information.
2. Type `A`: Basic Article Data - Includes basic information such as article number, description, price, unit, etc.
3. Type `B`: Additional Article Data - Includes supplementary details like alternative article number, weight, packaging amount, etc.
4. Type `P`: Price and Condition Data - Handles various price and condition information for an article.

The function is **still under development**. Future enhancements include handling long texts with insertions, bill of materials (BOM), and material surcharges. These additions will make the function more comprehensive and beneficial for processing Datanorm files.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1:  Convert Datanorm file to a PowerShell object
```powershell
PS C:\> $datanorm = Convert-FromDatanorm -path "C:\Users\john\Desktop\datanorm\Test\datanorm.001"
```

This command converts a Datanorm file located at `C:\Users\john\Desktop\datanorm\Test\datanorm.001` into a PowerShell object `$datanorm`. The object represents the content of the Datanorm file and can be further processed or manipulated in PowerShell. It has the four properties `v`, `a`, `b` and `p`. 

### Example 2:  Shows the data for a specific article number
```powershell
PS C:\> $datanorm = Convert-FromDatanorm -path "C:\Users\john\Desktop\datanorm\Test\datanorm.001"
PS C:\> $datanorm.a["8241335"]
```

Via `$datanorm.a` the individual field values can be retrieved and also addressed directly by specifying the article number. The same applies to the other properties like `$datanorm.b` or `$datanorm.p`.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Object
## NOTES

Currently, this function supports Datanorm version 4.0 only. Despite Datanorm 4.0 being an older standard, it is still widely used and relevant in many industries, particularly in Germany's building and construction sector. It provides a comprehensive and universal standard for electronic product data exchange between manufacturers, wholesalers and craftsmen in the HVAC sector. Datanorm 4.0 covers the basic and most commonly used elements, such as general product data (type A), additional product data (type B), version data (type V), and price data (type P). 

Datanorm 5.0 introduces additional complexities and features that are not yet supported by this function. The newer version extends the possibilities for the transfer of multimedia content, logistics data, long texts and other additional information. Should there be sufficient demand for Datanorm 5.0 support, we may consider enhancing this function accordingly in the future. 

It is important to note that due to the complexity and variety of data, there might be special cases which this function does not cover. It is recommended to thoroughly test this function with your specific Datanorm files to ensure compatibility.
