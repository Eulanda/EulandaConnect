# Fields

The field names used in the EULANDA merchandise management system have native German designations. There are efforts to provide an additional schema with English designations, but this is not even in planning yet. For this reason, there is a document here that lists and describes the names, as well as the places where they are used.

There are field names that are only used in export formats. These are usually calculated fields. This document specifically points this out.

| Fieldname in Tables or Views | English (Info)                  | Type      | Sample                                                       | Description                                                  |

A total of 3 lines are supported. The prefix 'DRUCK' means that it was specifically prepared for printing the document. Essentially, the content corresponds to the database field 'NAME1'. However, if the clerk, for example, left the second line of the name blank, the content of the 'DRUCK' labeled name will shift downward, causing the blank lines to move upward. This is for optical reasons to ensure that the address is printed as a cohesive whole. |

The real ID is not suitable for synchronization purposes. Therefore, this special field can be specified as the first one in the XML of the address or delivery note etc. It contains a unique key. Normally, for articles, this is the field 'ARTNUMMER', for addresses the field 'MATCH', for delivery notes the delivery note number, etc. However, it is possible to use other unique fields. These must then be agreed upon between the parties. For articles, for example, these could be ‘BARCODE’, ‘ID’, and ‘UID’. |
